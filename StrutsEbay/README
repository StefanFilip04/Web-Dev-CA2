my process of making this app
its currently 13/12/2025 when starting this project

make a website similar to ebay,
no marks going for ui frontend

need tomcat, 
need "MVC java based web framework Struts2" ??

i used my previous practice projet "StrutsCheckUser" as a base for this app.
pages i need, that use sessions:

user registration
user login
display whos logged in at all times
user logoff

(these dont use sessions)
view my profile
view others profile
view all users

add item for sale
view all items for sale

make a bid
view my bids
view all bids on an item

-------------------------------
mysql needs ebay_db

user needs name and password
items need name, price, seller_id (foreign key to users)

users need to put up items for sale then
bid on items and for their ones to display too...



create table users (
  user_id int primary key auto_increment,
  username varchar(50) unique not null,
  password varchar(50) not null,
);

/look over this later, i need more stuff i think/
create table items (
  item_id int primary key auto_increment,
  item_name varchar(100) not null,
  item_price decimal(10,2) not null,
  foreign key (seller_id) references users(user_id)
);


------------------------
/key things im learning/

difference between .jsp and .html

JSP is a dynamic server side file that runs java code and goes 
through tomcat first to be processed then back to webpage
can contain: java code, JSP tags, html

html is static and just displays content as is
